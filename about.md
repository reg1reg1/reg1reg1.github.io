<p class="message">
  I am a cyber security graduate student at NYU Tandon (formerly NYU Poly). 
  I have just begun to scale the mountain of cyber security.I am a infosec newbie who loves everything from Cryptography to Networking,from Web Application Security to Penetration testing, from Reversing to Discrete Maths. I was a member of the OSIRIS club at NYU Tandon School of Engineering and love playing CTF's , though I have just started doing so.. I am a junkie when it comes to cyber security- I am hooked it on bad. I love computers, and have come to realise that the best way to know how things work is to break them.
  
  2 major things that I am working on right now is Incident Response and Network forensics, and Cyber Metrics. I work on campus as systems developer in Vital Labs at NYU Tandon School of Engineering.


  I am ardent fan of DC comics, Marvel and love gaming.I love playing Counter Strike, Mortal Kombat and Injustice (big NRS fan) and Left4Dead2. I love playing the occassional game of Chess and love listening to Metal.
  I like travelling and have been lucky enough to visit 10+ countries. I love cooking which is a hobby I have recently acquired. 

  Feel free to check out my other repos, and drop me mail at yuvraj.singh19@gmail.com or ys3334@nyu.edu in case you want to connect or have any queries.
