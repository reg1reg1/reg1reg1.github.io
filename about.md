<p class="message">
  I am a cyber security graduate student at NYU Tandon (formerly NYU Poly). 
  I have just begun to scale the mountain of cyber security.I am a infosec newbie who loves everything from Cryptography to Networking,from Web Application Security to Penetration testing, from Reversing to Discrete Maths. I am a member of the OSIRIS club at NYU Tandon School of Engineering and love playing CTF's , though I have just started doing so.. I am a junkie when it comes to cyber security- I am hooked it on bad. I want to use this forum in reaching out and discussing security and technology with my peers and share whatever little I know in case it helps out someone.
  
  I am ardent fan of DC comics, Marvel and love gaming. I like travelling and have been lucky enough to visit 10+ countries. I love cooking which is a hobby I have recently acquired. 

  Feel free to check out my other repos, and drop me mail at yuvraj.singh19@gmail.com in case you want to connect or have any queries.
