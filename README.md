# Cybersecurity Rants

##About Me:
I am a cyber security graduate student at NYU Tandon (formerly NYU Poly). I have just begun to scale the mountain of cyber security.I am a infosec newbie who loves everything from Cryptography to Systems,from Web Application Security to Penetration testing, from Reversing to Discrete Maths. I aspire to learn more and more about the beauty which is information security. I am a junkie when it comes to cyber security- I am hooked it on bad. I want to use this forum in reaching out and discussing security and technology with my peers and share whatever little I know in case it helps out someone.
