title: My journey in information security
excerpt: >
 Yuvraj Singh, this is my journey into the world of information security and I put up writeups to CTF's, books , devices reviews and some techniques/exploits which has helped me during my year of being a cybersecurity major at NYU, Tandon School of Engineering. Feel free to check out my blogs, projects or get in touch with me using email or reach out over github if you want to collab or play CTF's together.

    - title: About Me
      excerpt: I am a cyber security graduate student at NYU Tandon (formerly NYU Poly). 
  I have just begun to scale the mountain of cyber security.I am a infosec newbie who loves everything from Cryptography to Networking,from Web Application Security to Penetration testing, from Reversing to Discrete Maths. I was a member of the OSIRIS club at NYU Tandon School of Engineering and love playing CTF's , though I have just started doing so.. I am a junkie when it comes to cyber security- I am hooked it on bad. I love computers, and have come to realise that the best way to know how things work is to break them.
