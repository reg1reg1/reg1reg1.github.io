title: My journey in information security
excerpt: >
 Yuvraj Singh, this is my journey into the world of computer science and information security and I put up writeups to CTF's, books , devices reviews and some techniques/exploits which has helped me during my year of being a cybersecurity major at NYU, Tandon School of Engineering. Feel free to check out my blogs, projects or get in touch with me using email or reach out over github if you want to collab or play CTF's together.
